# APC mini mle
Opinion oriented Midi Remote script for controlling Ableton Live using an APC mini.

This setup chose to fix track bar lengths : 
- 1st track is forced to 1 bar,
- 2nd and 3rd tracks are forced to 2 bars,
- 4th and 5th tracks are forced to 4 bars;
- Only last 3 tracks lengths are customisable by menu (default = 8).

This setup chose to allow multi-track record.
